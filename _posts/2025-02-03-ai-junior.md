### **How I Hired a Fast AI Junior Developer for $192 a Year**  

I've been coding for 25 years, constantly looking for ways to speed up development. Recently, I found a tool that completely changed how I write code.  

For just $192 a year, I essentially "hired" an AI junior developer—Cursor.ai with Claude 3.5. Now, instead of writing code myself, I focus on setting tasks, reviewing, and making corrections.  

#### **How My Workflow Changed**  

I used to break down large tasks, prioritize them, and manually write the code. Now, I assign these tasks to [Cursor.com](https://cursor.com). It writes the code, covers it with tests, fixes bugs, and I only step in to guide and review the results. In the end, about 80% of the code is good to go, and I fine-tune the remaining 20%.  

#### **What AI Does Best**  

It excels at tasks with a clearly defined expected outcome. But there are some quirks:  
- It struggles when it's unclear which library versions to use, especially if APIs have changed.  
- Sometimes, it modifies parts of the code I didn’t ask it to touch, showing unexpected "initiative"—which can be either useful or frustrating.  

But at times, it really impresses me! For example, I once asked it to analyze my code for potential race conditions, and it not only highlighted unexpected issues but also suggested fixes based on existing patterns in my project.  

#### **How My Role Has Changed**  

I feel like I’ve hired a super-fast junior dev who works 24/7 and gets things right about 80% of the time.  
My productivity has increased 2-3 times. I get more done and, more importantly, I have more time to think things through and even take breaks.  

#### **Is $192 a Year Worth It?**  

For me—absolutely. It's a fully justified investment. I used to have a Copilot subscription but canceled it because it was more of a distraction than a help.  

Who would I recommend it to? Pretty much anyone! I even saw a 5-year-old girl build an AI-powered chat with Harry Potter just by giving Cursor.ai commands—without knowing anything about web development. This is mind-blowing and has potential across many fields.  

The key is learning how to set tasks properly. Once you do, AI won’t get in your way—it’ll actually help you.
