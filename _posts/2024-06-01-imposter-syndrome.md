### Introduction

In 2022, I was working in a Russian company when suddenly war broke out, and I made the decision to leave the country and not return. I urgently started looking for a job abroad and literally fell into a trap. I found myself in a vulnerable position, in a country new to me, working for an outstaff company where work processes explicitly and implicitly reinforced my doubts about my qualifications and triggered imposter syndrome.

In this article I will share how I recognised my condition, sought help and regained my productivity and mental health. I will share important points about imposter syndrome. If you feel that my story resonates with you, then feel free to give the article a like or dislike and share your stories in the comments.

Imposter Syndrome is a psychological pattern in which individuals doubt their skills, talents, or accomplishments and have a persistent fear of being exposed as a "fraud." Despite evident success and external validation, those experiencing Imposter Syndrome often attribute their achievements to luck, timing, or other external factors rather than their own competence and effort. This phenomenon is characterized by chronic self-doubt, feelings of inadequacy, and a disconnect between one's perceived and actual performance.

Imposter Syndrome is surprisingly common in the workplace, affecting employees across various industries and levels of experience. Studies indicate that nearly 70% of people will experience imposter feelings at some point in their careers. High-achieving individuals, particularly those in competitive or high-pressure environments, are especially susceptible. The prevalence of Imposter Syndrome can lead to significant psychological stress, impacting both personal well-being and professional performance.

Employers, whether intentionally or unintentionally, can exploit employees' Imposter Syndrome to their advantage. Recognizing the signs of self-doubt and insecurity, some employers may leverage these feelings to manipulate employees, extracting more work without adequate compensation or recognition. This exploitation can take various forms, such as undervaluing contributions, delaying promotions, overloading employees with tasks, and fostering an environment where fear of failure is omnipresent. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for both employees and employers to foster healthier, more equitable workplaces.

### Understanding Imposter Syndrome

In many companies in post-Soviet countries, part of the working culture involves attributing achievements and successes to some abstract collective rather than to the contributions of specific individuals. This mentality, a remnant of the Soviet Union, has persisted. When I found a job in a company with offices all over the world, I was hopeful. However, I soon realized that the entire management consisted mostly of people who had grown up in the Soviet Union. Naively, I expected that the legacy of communist propaganda had weathered out of the minds of those who had linked their business with Western countries. Instead, I found myself in an environment where my individual contributions were often overlooked, and the pervasive culture of collective credit reinforced my doubts about my qualifications, exacerbating my imposter syndrome.

For instance, every couple of weeks, I had to call a manager whom I only interacted with during those calls. The manager, with a stern tone, demanded to see the tasks in the customer's JIRA and pretended to write something down. Despite these regular check-ins, I never received any feedback. At the time, I perceived it as typical micromanagement. In a well-developed remote working culture, such checks are not required; employees are responsible for their results to the team and to the users of the product they develop. And such checks simply increase the pressure on the employee, leave them without feedback and trigger the development of impostor syndrome. 

#### Symptoms and Characteristics
Imposter Syndrome manifests in various ways, often leading individuals to question their abilities and fear being exposed as frauds. Common symptoms include:
- **Persistent Self-Doubt:** Constantly questioning one's skills and qualifications, even in the face of evidence to the contrary. 
- **Attributing Success to External Factors:** Believing that achievements are due to luck, timing, or the efforts of others rather than one's own abilities.
- **Perfectionism:** Setting excessively high standards and feeling like a failure if those standards are not met.
- **Fear of Failure:** Intense anxiety about making mistakes or not meeting expectations, leading to avoidance of challenges.
- **Overworking:** Compensating for perceived inadequacies by putting in extra hours and effort, often leading to burnout.
- **Discounting Praise:** Dismissing positive feedback and assuming others are simply being kind or deceived.

#### Common Triggers and Contributing Factors
Several factors can trigger or exacerbate Imposter Syndrome, including:
- **Workplace Culture:** High-pressure environments and competitive atmospheres can amplify feelings of inadequacy.
- **Transitions and New Roles:** Starting a new job, receiving a promotion, or taking on new responsibilities can trigger self-doubt.
- **Perfectionist Tendencies:** Individuals with perfectionist tendencies are more likely to experience Imposter Syndrome.
- **Social Comparisons:** Comparing oneself to colleagues, especially in a social media-driven world, can heighten feelings of inadequacy.
- **Early Family Dynamics:** Childhood experiences, such as high parental expectations or sibling rivalry, can contribute to imposter feelings.
- **Lack of Representation:** Underrepresented groups in the workplace may feel additional pressure to prove themselves, leading to heightened imposter feelings.

#### Impact on Employee Performance and Well-Being
Imposter Syndrome can have profound effects on both employee performance and overall well-being:
- **Decreased Productivity:** Constant self-doubt can lead to procrastination, over-preparation, and difficulty in making decisions, all of which hinder productivity.
- **Burnout:** The relentless drive to prove oneself can result in overworking and burnout, impacting both physical and mental health.
- **Stifled Innovation:** Fear of failure can prevent employees from taking risks or suggesting new ideas, stifling creativity and innovation.
- **Career Stagnation:** Reluctance to seek promotions or new opportunities due to self-doubt can lead to career stagnation.
- **Reduced Job Satisfaction:** The ongoing stress and anxiety associated with Imposter Syndrome can lead to decreased job satisfaction and a negative work experience.
- **Mental Health Issues:** Chronic feelings of inadequacy and stress can contribute to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.

### Employer Exploitation of Imposter Syndrome

After a while, my direct manager suggested I call about an important issue but didn't specify what it was. During the call, he informed me that the project I was currently working on would soon collapse, and everything was going poorly, urging me to leave it and prepare for an interview for a new project. When I asked him how he knew something was wrong with the project, he didn't provide any specifics, simply repeating that the project would soon close and everything was bad.

I told him I needed some time to think and make a decision. I then talked to the team members on the project and discovered that nothing of the sort was planned; instead, the project was set to gradually develop and even expand its activities. It was then that I clearly understood how the 'outstaff' model works: they sell me as a developer to a project, evaluate my performance, and if I deliver well, they manipulate the situation to sell me to a more expensive project where they will earn three times more for my services while offering me only a 5% increase in remuneration.

#### Recognizing Imposter Syndrome in Employees
Employers who are attuned to their employees' behaviors can often recognize signs of Imposter Syndrome. Indicators include:
- **Frequent Self-Deprecation:** Employees may downplay their accomplishments or frequently question their own abilities.
- **Reluctance to Take Credit:** Employees might attribute their successes to others or to external factors, rarely accepting praise.
- **Overworking:** Employees with Imposter Syndrome often work excessive hours, feeling they need to constantly prove their worth.
- **Avoidance of Challenges:** They may shy away from new projects or responsibilities due to fear of failure.
- **Perfectionism:** An insistence on flawlessness can be a sign, as these employees may struggle to accept mistakes or imperfections.

#### Manipulative Tactics Used by Employers
Employers can exploit these vulnerabilities to manipulate employees, extracting more work and loyalty without fair compensation or recognition. Common tactics include:

##### Undervaluing Work and Achievements
- **Minimizing Contributions:** Employers may downplay the significance of an employee's work, making them feel that their efforts are not particularly valuable.
- **Insufficient Praise:** Giving little to no recognition for accomplishments can perpetuate feelings of inadequacy.

##### Delaying or Denying Promotions and Raises
- **Promising Future Rewards:** Employers might use the promise of future promotions or raises to keep employees motivated without actually following through.
- **Stringent Criteria:** Setting excessively high or vague standards for advancement can keep employees in a state of perpetual effort without reward.

##### Overloading with Work and Unreasonable Expectations
- **Excessive Workloads:** Assigning more work than is reasonable, knowing the employee will strive to meet these demands in an attempt to prove themselves.
- **Unclear Expectations:** Giving ambiguous or constantly changing expectations can keep employees off balance and feeling inadequate.

##### Leveraging Fear of Failure and Self-Doubt
- **Micromanagement:** Overly scrutinizing work can exacerbate self-doubt and the fear of making mistakes.
- **Creating a Fear-Based Culture:** Emphasizing the negative consequences of failure rather than fostering a supportive environment can keep employees anxious and compliant.

### Consequences for Employees

After realizing that I was being over-pressured, not given feedback, and manipulated, I decided to look for a new job and leave the 'outstaff' company. To my shock, I discovered that my contract required a notice period of two months! This practice raised many questions about how the agreements were legally formalized and how detailed the hiring managers were in negotiating the terms of employment.

Despite this setback, I spent the next two months actively going on interviews and responding to job vacancies. My efforts paid off: I received five job offers and ultimately chose the one that offered the clearest terms and conditions along with decent pay.

At my next job, the first few months seemed like a typical experience in a product company. However, just a couple of days after my probationary period ended, the CTO abruptly fired our team leader, stating, "I've always disliked the way you work." This was a huge red flag, indicating that the company didn‚Äôt value its people or understand how to provide constructive feedback.

My concerns were soon confirmed: the company's work culture was fear-driven. In the year I spent there, I clearly understood the team's purpose only once. The feedback I received was always vague, with comments like, "Overall, you seem to be doing something, but it feels like you need to do more and better." When I tried to clarify what exactly was expected, I was told, "We expect different things from a senior," without any specifics.

Unfortunately, I didn't have the resources to re-enter the job market at that time. I was dealing with grief in my family, as my mum had passed away after a sudden illness, which consumed most of my energy. I endured at this company for nearly another year before quitting in March 2024. Upon leaving, I provided detailed feedback to the HR director and decided to take a breather to rest and regain my energy.

#### Mental Health Implications
Imposter Syndrome can significantly impact an employee's mental health, leading to:
- **Anxiety:** Persistent self-doubt and fear of being exposed as a fraud can cause chronic anxiety, making it difficult for employees to relax and feel secure in their roles.
- **Depression:** The constant pressure to perform and feelings of inadequacy can contribute to depression, marked by feelings of hopelessness, lack of motivation, and a negative self-view.
- **Low Self-Esteem:** Employees with Imposter Syndrome often struggle with low self-esteem, believing they are less competent or deserving than their peers.
- **Stress:** The ongoing stress of trying to meet unrealistic expectations and the fear of failure can lead to physical symptoms such as headaches, insomnia, and other stress-related conditions.

#### Career Stagnation and Burnout
The pressure and self-doubt associated with Imposter Syndrome can hinder career progression and lead to burnout:
- **Avoidance of Advancement:** Employees may avoid seeking promotions or new opportunities due to fear of not being good enough, leading to career stagnation.
- **Overworking:** In an attempt to prove their worth, employees often work excessive hours, which can result in physical and emotional exhaustion.
- **Burnout:** The relentless effort to meet high standards and the lack of recognition or reward can lead to burnout, characterized by fatigue, cynicism, and reduced professional efficacy.
- **Underutilization of Skills:** Self-doubt may prevent employees from fully utilizing their skills or taking on roles that match their capabilities, limiting their professional growth and potential.

#### Decreased Job Satisfaction and Productivity
Imposter Syndrome can adversely affect job satisfaction and overall productivity:
- **Diminished Job Satisfaction:** The lack of recognition and the constant pressure to prove oneself can lead to decreased job satisfaction, making work feel unfulfilling and stressful.
- **Reduced Engagement:** Employees struggling with Imposter Syndrome may become disengaged, feeling disconnected from their work and less motivated to contribute.
- **Procrastination:** Fear of failure and perfectionism can lead to procrastination, where employees delay tasks to avoid the anxiety associated with potential mistakes.
- **Inefficiency:** The tendency to overprepare or excessively check work can make employees less efficient, slowing down their overall productivity.
- **Interpersonal Strain:** The stress and self-doubt associated with Imposter Syndrome can strain relationships with colleagues, leading to conflicts and a less collaborative work environment.

### Strategies for Employees to Combat Exploitation

As I write this article, I am in the process of overcoming imposter syndrome. I was laid off exactly three months ago. In the chapter below, titled [Knowing When to Leave a Toxic Workplace](/#knowing-when-to-leave-a-toxic-workplace), I will describe how it happened for me. In a nutshell, I was fired after I sought clarification about the company's communication and management practices.

I asked if this way of communicating and managing the team was standard practice or if it was an excessive anomaly. I also questioned why the promised annual remuneration review had been ignored after a year, and everyone seemed to pretend it had never been mentioned. I found the corporate management standards in the company's documentation, which had a link to a Russian-language resource with a roadmap for developing team leader competencies ([tlroadmap.io](https://tlroadmap.io/)). I suggested that our team leader explore ways to assess my personal effectiveness and build professional relationships within the team, attaching links to this resource.

Instead of discussing possible improvements to company processes that would enhance teamwork, I was informed that it was my last day on the job. Thus, I left an environment that was toxic to me, and I am grateful for that decision. Thank you!!! I now have a compelling story about how creating productive conflict can quickly confirm or dispel doubts about cultural fit.

#### Recognizing and Addressing Imposter Syndrome
The first step in combating Imposter Syndrome is to recognize and address it:
- **Self-Awareness:** Identify the patterns of self-doubt and recognize when they arise. Understanding the triggers and symptoms is crucial for addressing them.
- **Reframe Negative Thoughts:** Challenge and reframe negative self-talk. Replace thoughts of inadequacy with positive affirmations about your skills and accomplishments.
- **Acknowledge Achievements:** Keep a record of your successes and contributions. Regularly review this list to remind yourself of your capabilities and achievements.

#### Building Confidence and Self-Advocacy
Confidence and self-advocacy are essential in overcoming Imposter Syndrome and avoiding exploitation:
- **Set Realistic Goals:** Break tasks into manageable steps and set achievable goals. Celebrate small victories to build confidence over time.
- **Self-Advocacy Training:** Learn to advocate for yourself by negotiating for fair compensation, seeking promotions, and asking for recognition when deserved.
- **Continuous Learning:** Invest in your professional development. Gaining new skills and knowledge can boost confidence and reduce feelings of inadequacy.

#### Seeking Support from Mentors and Peers
Support from mentors and peers can provide valuable perspective and encouragement:
- **Find a Mentor:** Seek out a mentor who can offer guidance, share their experiences, and provide constructive feedback. A mentor can help you navigate challenges and build confidence.

Recognizing a toxic workplace and knowing when to leave is vital for long-term well-being:
- **Assess the Environment:** Regularly assess your work environment. If it is consistently toxic, exploitative, and detrimental to your mental health, it may be time to consider leaving.
- **Look for Red Flags:** Be aware of red flags, such as consistent undervaluing of your work, lack of support, and unfulfilled promises of promotions or raises.
- **Prepare for Transition:** If leaving is necessary, prepare for the transition by updating your resume, networking, and exploring new job opportunities. Ensure you have a support system in place during the transition.

### Recommendations for Ethical Employer Practices

I have experienced working with companies whose cultures were not conducive to talented and hardworking individuals thriving and discovering their abilities. I‚Äôve studied numerous examples of how organizations dominated by fear-based cultures fail and how to transform such cultures. A valuable resource I found is ["The Fearless Organization: Creating Psychological Safety in the Workplace for Learning, Innovation, and Growth"](https://amzn.to/3Vo0Ucp). I highly recommend it to anyone who considers themselves an ethical employer focused on innovation and productivity.

#### Creating a Supportive Work Environment
A supportive work environment is crucial for fostering employee well-being and productivity:
- **Open Communication:** Encourage open, transparent communication where employees feel safe to express concerns and share ideas without fear of judgment.
- **Psychological Safety:** Foster an atmosphere where mistakes are viewed as learning opportunities rather than failures. Ensure employees feel safe to take risks and innovate.
- **Inclusive Culture:** Promote diversity and inclusion, ensuring all employees feel valued and respected regardless of their background or identity.

#### Providing Regular, Constructive Feedback
Constructive feedback helps employees grow and feel recognized for their contributions:
- **Regular Check-Ins:** Schedule regular one-on-one meetings to provide feedback, discuss progress, and address any concerns employees may have.
- **Specific and Actionable:** Offer specific, actionable feedback that employees can use to improve their performance. Avoid vague or overly critical comments.
- **Balanced Approach:** Balance constructive criticism with positive reinforcement. Recognize strengths and achievements while providing guidance on areas for improvement.

#### Promoting a Culture of Recognition and Appreciation
Recognition and appreciation are key to motivating employees and reducing feelings of inadequacy:
- **Public Acknowledgment:** Regularly acknowledge and celebrate employee achievements in team meetings, newsletters, or through company-wide announcements.
- **Incentive Programs:** Implement incentive programs, such as Employee of the Month awards, bonuses, or other rewards to recognize exceptional performance.
- **Peer Recognition:** Encourage peer-to-peer recognition programs where employees can acknowledge and appreciate each other‚Äôs contributions.

#### Encouraging Professional Development and Growth
Supporting professional development helps employees build confidence and advance their careers:
- **Training Opportunities:** Provide access to training programs, workshops, and courses that enable employees to develop new skills and stay updated with industry trends.
- **Career Pathing:** Offer clear career paths and development plans. Work with employees to set goals and provide the resources needed to achieve them.
- **Mentorship Programs:** Establish mentorship programs that pair experienced employees with those seeking guidance and growth, fostering knowledge sharing and professional development.

Reflecting on my journey, I've realized the importance of recognizing and addressing imposter syndrome. My experiences in various work environments, particularly in companies with fear-based cultures, have taught me valuable lessons about self-worth and the necessity of a supportive workplace.

Leaving a toxic workplace was one of the best decisions I made. It allowed me to seek out an environment where my contributions are valued and where I can grow both personally and professionally. My story is a testament to the power of standing up for oneself and finding a work culture that aligns with one's values.

For employees facing similar challenges, I encourage you to recognize your worth and seek environments that nurture your talents. For employers, fostering a culture of psychological safety and constructive feedback is crucial for innovation and productivity.
