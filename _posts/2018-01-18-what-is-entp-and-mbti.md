Well, what is ENTP?

<p><h2>Extraversion, iNtuition, Thinking, Perception</h2> abbreviation, used for description personal typology Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI).</p>
<p>A fairly popular and time-tested technique for self-knowledge and building strong teams. There is not much information on this technique on the Russian-speaking Internet, but there are several free tests and the translation of the book <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Do-What-You-Are-Personality/dp/031623673X'>"Do What You Are" by Paul Tieger</a> with detailed examples of how awareness of your strengths and weaknesses can help you improve your quality of life and find yourself!</p>

<p><h2>www.16personalities.com</h2> <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">free test</a> with a fun set of celebrities or art heroes with the same personality type. For example, Captain Jack Sparrow, Adam Savage from Mythbusters and Thomas Edison - ENTP. The minus of this test is that the results are called by some unclear roles, for example, entp there is called "Debateur". Which to say the least is not the most striking feature. The service is developed by the community, so the main thing to take from this test is to make the first approximation in order to understand yourself. First of all, your MBTI personality type.</p>
