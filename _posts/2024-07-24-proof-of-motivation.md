### Investor Pitch for Dapp Testing of Candidate Motivation

#### **Introduction**

Hiring the right talent is a critical challenge for businesses worldwide. Traditional methods of assessing candidate suitability often fail to account for a candidate's intrinsic motivation, which is a key factor in job performance and employee retention. Our innovative decentralized application (dApp) aims to revolutionize the hiring process by testing and scoring candidates' motivation and alignment with specific job vacancies. This dApp leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and trust in the hiring process.
