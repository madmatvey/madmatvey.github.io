## Hobbies

- Albert Einstein had a hobby of driving a sailboat. It [helped him to understand how the universe works](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-25/how-a-love-of-sailing-helped-einstien-explain-the-universe/9190970). I have a licence to captain a sailboat for recreational purposes. [Here is the sailing school](https://www.seanation.com/school) I chose and warmly recommend to those who want to really learn how to sail a sailboat, not just get a captain's licence.

- Playing guitar can stimulate creativity and provide a relaxing break from work. Sometimes I make short videos of me playing guitar, [here's one of them](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/shot/madmatvey/669363136).

- Sometimes on the weekends I stream live, play deejay live mix on my YouTube channel [Lazy Beat](https://www.youtube.com/@lazybeatdjs). Subscribe, give me likes!.
