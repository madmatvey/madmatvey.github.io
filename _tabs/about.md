## Leader and Ruby Engineer

{% crypto_donations %}

I have over 8 years of experience as a self-driven engineering manager and programmer, specializing in Ruby, with some Golang and JavaScript thrown in. I take pride in owning the results of my product team. As an [ENTP](https://www.16personalities.com/entp-personality), I thrive in debates and love tackling challenges. I've broken things, fixed them, and turned big dreams into reality, all while honing my endurance and perseverance.
In my work, I focus on solving real problems and delivering measurable value to users. As a leader, I prioritize clean code, solid architecture, and clear communication skills to drive project success. I believe in simplicity and iterative development for building complex systems. I appreciate clear and transparent communication, which is key to project success.
I'm looking for a long-term partnership with a company that values transparency and puts people first, including engineers, customers, and users.

## Personal Information

## Hobbies

- Albert Einstein had a hobby of driving a sailboat. It [helped him to understand how the universe works](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-25/how-a-love-of-sailing-helped-einstien-explain-the-universe/9190970). I have a licence to captain a sailboat for recreational purposes. [Here is the sailing school](https://www.seanation.com/school) I chose and warmly recommend to those who want to really learn how to sail a sailboat, not just get a captain's licence.

- Playing guitar can stimulate creativity and provide a relaxing break from work. Sometimes I make short videos of me playing guitar, [here's one of them](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/shot/madmatvey/669363136).
